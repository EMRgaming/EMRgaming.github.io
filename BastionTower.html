								<p>The turret system was something I decided I wanted to take on myself. I worked torwards trying to have a 
									fun exciting way to have the turrets be useful to the player and a way to upgrade the turrets so that the player
									has assistance taking on the enemies. I started with the basic turret and worked on tracking enemies and 
									getting the turret to aim torwards and shooting at said enemy.
								</p>

								<p>Next I moved on to being able to buy and place a turret where the player would like. I started with
									making a menu that would allow the player to select the turret to purchase. Then I added a placeholder turret
									to show the player where the turret would be placed. This was a fun and interesting process trying to figure out
									how to have the turrets spawn and be palced correctly according to the player.

								<p>I also worked on designing most of the menus for our game.</p>
